        <h5>General Assembly - Software Engineering Immersive Course</h5>
        <h6>London, U.K.</h6>
        <h6>March 2021 to June 2021</h6>
        <p>I learned and applied the fundamentals of front-end and back-end web development in this immersive remote course, using Agile project delivery techniques. The course consisted of daily stand-ups, online lectures, group labs, pair-programming and homeworks, and allowed me to be part of a cohort with a strong mutual support. The course also had four major solo or group portfolio projects to solidify and implement the technical concepts we were learning</p>
