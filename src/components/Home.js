      <h1>Elsa Guibert <small>(She/Her)</small></h1>
      <h2>Junior Web Developer</h2>

      <p>Iâ€™m a creative problem-solver with a constant drive to learn and apply my skills to interesting challenges. I started my journey into coding through self-taught HTML and CSS on open-source websites. I discovered my passion for programming and the challenges it brings. My interest therefore grew into a professional ambition and I fast-tracked my learning at General Assembly with an Immersive Software Engineering course where I deepened my knowledge of front-end and back-end software development. With a strong enthusiasm to continue exploring the world of software engineering I am looking for a challenging new role as a software developer to apply my technical and management skills.</p>
